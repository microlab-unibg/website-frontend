          From industry to everyday life, the current trend is to collect valuable information with zero impact, low cost and for long spans of time. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the most famous paradigm to make this idea work: a network of smart sensors connected to the Internet that gather data, forward them to accumulators that can exploit them and find useful patterns and information starting from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microlab has been working extensively on different wearable and IoT platforms applied to multiple fields with a common target: miniaturization and long battery life. The areas of application, and fields of interest, of such systems are unbound: from orientation and motion tracking system for industry to dynamic ECG system, dehydration monitoring platforms and beam diagnostic architecture for medical applications. The expertise of the group spans from the hardware, namely components, PCB design and integration, to the firmware and data analysis. Different miniaturised platforms have been developed, tested and applied to use cases with a great success.

          Microlab has developed several custom low-noise front-end circuits for radiation detector readout in different national and international collaboration frames. The technologies used by the laboratory are varied, but CMOS is the usual choice when it comes to integrated circuits for the experience the group holds on the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group has been developing mixed-signal circuits in CMOS technologies from the 180 nm down to the 28 nm node to readout both pixellated and striped detectors. The target of the typical application is very low noise detection of target particles, together with low power specification and compact area for high level of integration and spatial resolution. The group has also experience on design of I/O blocks and band-gap references. There is also expertise with 3D integration technologies to produce multilayer analog-digital integrated circuits.

          CMOS technologies are widely used for the design and development of mixed-signal circuits. They enable a high level of integration and high fault tolerance in a hard radiation scenario. The continuous scaling of the technology nodes calls for thorough studies on their analog performance, in particular noise ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this field, the group developed an accurate noise model that accounts for secondary effects of scaled CMOS technologies, such as short channel effects and parasitic effects from gate and substrate resistances. The model has been validated across different CMOS technology nodes and with commercial and custom-developed electronics. Moreover, radiation hardness studies in different technologies have been pursued with a focus on noise and analog performance in general, as such characteristic is of paramount importance in spatial, x-ray imaging and high energy physics experiments.
